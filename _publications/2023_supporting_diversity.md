excerpt: 'Which role do party gatekeepers play in shaping the political representation of immigrants? We address this question by analyzing unique survey data collected at party list nomination events, containing individual level attitudes of party gatekeepers towards this issue. We find that apart from political ideology solidarity between underrepresented groups seems to play a central role, in shaping the support for immigrant-origin candidates. \n
