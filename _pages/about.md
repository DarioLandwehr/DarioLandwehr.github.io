Welcome
===============
<p style='text-align: justify;'> I am Pre-Doc at the <a href="https://www.cbs.dk/en/research/departments-and-centres/department-of-international-economics-government-and-business/staff/dregb">Department of International Economics, Business and Government</a> at Copenhagen Business School (CBS). In my research, I am broadly interested in applying computational methods to study political phenomena in the area of Comparative Politics and Political Communication. </p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'> I am especially interested in methods-research for repurposing large unstrctured (found) datasources to analyze political behavior. Currently, in my Pre-Doc, I am working in the DFG/ ANR funded <a href="https://www.janstuckatz.com/denazdb">DeNazDB Project</a>, where we construct a micro-level Database from historical denazification questionnaires collected after WWII, utilizing computer-vision. Furthermore I am woking with large text corpora from parliamentary records, using NLP methods and prediction modelling, to analyze the behavior of political elites. Substantialy I have a special interest in radical right actors. </p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'> Before joining CBS I obtained a Master of Science in Social Data Sciecne from the University of Copenhagen (Denmark) and a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science from Leibniz University Hannover (Germany). </p>
