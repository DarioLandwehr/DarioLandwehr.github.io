I am Pre-Doc at the [Department of International Economics, Business and Government](https://www.cbs.dk/en/research/departments-and-centres/department-of-international-economics-government-and-business/staff/dregb) at Copenhagen Business School (CBS).
In my research, I am interested in applying computational methods to study and measure political phenomena broadly in the area of Comparative Politics. 

I use methods from Natural Language Processing to analyze unstructured text data e.g. from Social Media or parliamentary records. 

Substantialy my interest focuses on the behavior of political elites with a special focus on actors of the extreme right. 

Before joining CBS I completed my undergraduate studies in Poitical Science at Leibniz University Hannover (Germany) and obtained a M.Sc. in Social data Sciecne from the University of Copenhagen (Denmark).
