I am Pre-Doc at the [Department of International Economics, Business and Government](https://www.cbs.dk/en/research/departments-and-centres/department-of-international-economics-government-and-business/staff/dregb) at Copenhagen Business School (CBS).
In my research, I am interested in applying computational methods to study and measure political phenomena broadly in the area of Comparative Politics.
