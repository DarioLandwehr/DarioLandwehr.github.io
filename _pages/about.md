Welcome
===============
<p style='text-align: justify;'> I am Pre-Doc at the <a href="https://www.cbs.dk/en/research/departments-and-centres/department-of-international-economics-government-and-business/staff/dregb">Department of International Economics, Business and Government</a> at Copenhagen Business School (CBS). I am broadly interested in computational methods in the area of comparative politics and political communication. Substantially I have an interest in extreme political actors. </p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'> In my research I repurpose large unstrctured quantitative datasources, e.g. parliamentary records, social media data or archival material, to analyze political behavior. Currently, I am working as a Pre-Doc in the DFG/ ANR funded <a href="https://www.janstuckatz.com/denazdb">DeNazDB Project</a>. The project constructs a micro-level panel database from historical denazification questionnaires collected by the allied occupation forces after WWII.</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'> In another project I am woking with large text corpora from parliamentary records. Using NLP and supervised machine learning we analyze the coalition behavior of political elites from mainstream and populist radical right parties. </p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'> Before joining CBS I obtained my master's degree in Social Data Sciecne from the University of Copenhagen (Denmark) and a bachelor in Political Science from Leibniz University Hannover (Germany). </p>
