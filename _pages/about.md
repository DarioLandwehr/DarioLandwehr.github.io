Welcome
===============
<p style='text-align: justify;'> I am a PhD Student at the <a href="https://www.polver.uni-konstanz.de/cnc/">Department of Politics and Public Administration</a> at the University of Konstanz. My PhD-project evolves around auditing algorithmic decisions of social media platforms to get a better understanding how platforms automatically moderate content and how this affects political behaviour. My PhD is part of the research project <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240304205056/https://www.polver.uni-konstanz.de/cnc/news/details/es-geht-um-den-umgang-mit-falschinformationen-und-hassbotschaften/">Transparency in Content Moderation</a>, in collaboration with UCSD and TUM. </p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'> My research interests are within Computational Social Science, especially in how large unstructured data sources can help to answer questions grounded in Comparative Politics, Political Communication and Political Economy. An additional substantive interest of mine are extreme political actors.</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'> Before I started my PhD, I obtained my master's degree in Social Data Sciecne from the University of Copenhagen and a bachelor in Political Science from Leibniz University Hannover. Furthermore, I worked for one year as a Pre-doc at Copenhagen Business School's <a href="https://www.cbs.dk/en/research/departments-and-centres/department-of-international-economics-government-and-business/">Department of International Economics, Business and Government</a>, where I am still affiliated.</p>
